                        It is sure that we have reached an advanced level of deterioration but it is never too late to START TAKING ACTIONS. And for those actions to produce the desired outcomes, we need to be ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

                    <p>
                        We need to reduce the gas emission. That may seem impossible because that is our main source of energy in the world as we use it in almost every aspect of our lives â€“ to power cell phones, computers, offices and so forth. Rather, we need to learn to USE MORE CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGIES such as solar and wind energy.
Besides, we need to set more efficient regulations about the use of gas consumption for cars and transportations services. We limit to the least of the use of gas and even PRIORITIZE USING ELECTRIC CARS.

                    <p>
                        We also could learn to do agriculture differently and learn how to better grow and manage crops. We also need to plant thousands of trees to recover the earth and lessen the impact of the climate change. Another thing we could learn to use and manage lands differently.

                        Sure, all that has been mentioned above may not guarantee the total refection of the damage already caused but it may slow down and as time goes, why not, eradicate it.
