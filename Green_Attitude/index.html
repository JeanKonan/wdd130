                    The world has so drastically changed over these recent decades. And that is surely not good news. The human race has had a very destructive effect on the environment lately and that effect depicts on every other being living around. Trees have been and are even still being cut down to create new cities here and there. Industries have been using more and more energy producing ever-increasing pollution. Many pandemics have erupted at an unusual rate, killing by the way, thousands of people throughout the world. If nothing is done and fast, the world, as we know it and like it, might no longer exist in a few centuries if not decades. Now is the time to TAKE ACTION! Now is the time to BUILD A HERITAGE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. We need to start building the NEXT WORLD and it will only be possible if we change our destructive habits. We all need to be more environmentalist and adopt a GREENER ATTITUDE toward our planet. No one will do that for us. It is our duty to turn things around and we need to do it as soon as possible; at least before it gets too late. So, no more time to waste, join GREEN ATTITUDE NOW!
