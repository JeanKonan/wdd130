                    I guess by now, you may be wondering what it means to have a GREEN ATTITUDE and what is this site all about. Well! To keep it simple, to have a GREEN ATTITUDE means to get more environmentally aware or friendly. And now, you may surely think you are already eco-friendly enough and that is article surely is not for you. If you have already got eco-friendly attitudes, that is AWESOME! Please KEEP IT UP! If not yet, then COME ON my friend! Let’s get started!

                    Did you know that the simple fact of turning the lights off when leaving a room is being eco-friendly? Yes, it is. The energy that is being used to lighten and warm our homes and cities are taken mostly from charcoal gazes. And those sources of energy are highly destructive for the environment; so, the lesser we use them, the lesser we need them and the lesser they will be produced.

                <p>
                    In fact, the production of those energy sources heats up the earth thus causing the icebergs to melt. That increases the ocean level and causing natural disasters in different places on earth. This is just an example between many others.
Actually, every action, as insignificant as it may seem, counts. So, let’s HAVE A GREEN ATTITUDE!
