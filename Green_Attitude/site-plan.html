        The world has so drastically changed over these recent decades. And that is surely not good news. The human race has had a very destructive effect on the environment lately and that effect depicts on every other being living around. Trees have been and are even still being cut down to create new cities here and there. Industries have been using more and more energy producing ever-increasing pollution. Many pandemics have erupted at an unusual rate, killing by the way, thousands of people throughout the world. If nothing is done and fast, the world, as we know it and like it, might no longer exist in a few centuries if not decades. Now is the time to TAKE ACTION! Now is the time to BUILD A HERITAGE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. We need to start building the NEXT WORLD and it will only be possible if we change our destructive habits. We all need to be more environmentalist and adopt a GREENER ATTITUDE toward our planet. No one will do that for us. It is our duty to turn things around and we need to do it as soon as possible; at least before it gets too late. So, no more time to waste, join GREEN ATTITUDE NOW!

      <h3>CAUSES</h3>
      <p>
        I guess by now, you may be wondering what it means to have a GREEN ATTITUDE and what is this site all about. Well! To keep it simple, to have a GREEN ATTITUDE means to get more environmentally aware or friendly. And now, you may surely think you are already eco-friendly enough and that is article surely is not for you. If you have already got eco-friendly attitudes, that is AWESOME! Please KEEP IT UP! If not yet, then COME ON my friend! Let’s get started!
Did you know that the simple fact of turning the lights off when leaving a room is being eco-friendly? Yes, it is. The energy that is being used to lighten and warm our homes and cities are taken mostly from charcoal gazes. And those sources of energy are highly destructive for the environment; so, the lesser we use them, the lesser we need them and the lesser they will be produced. In fact, the production of those energy sources heats up the earth thus causing the icebergs to melt. That increases the ocean level and causing natural disasters in different places on earth. This is just an example between many others.
Actually, every action, as insignificant as it may seem, counts. So, let’s HAVE A GREEN ATTITUDE!

      </ul>
      <h3>SOLUTIONS</h3>
      <p>
        It is sure that we have reached an advanced level of deterioration but it is never too late to START TAKING ACTIONS. And for those actions to produce the desired outcomes, we need to be ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.
We need to reduce the gas emission. That may seem impossible because that is our main source of energy in the world as we use it in almost every aspect of our lives – to power cell phones, computers, offices and so forth. Rather, we need to learn to USE MORE CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGIES such as solar and wind energy.
Besides, we need to set more efficient regulations about the use of gas consumption for cars and transportations services. We limit to the least of the use of gas and even PRIORITIZE USING ELECTRIC CARS.
We also could learn to do agriculture differently and learn how to better grow and manage crops. We also need to plant thousands of trees to recover the earth and lessen the impact of the climate change. Another thing we could learn to use and manage lands differently.
Sure, all that has been mentioned above may not guarantee the total refection of the damage already caused but it may slow down and as time goes, why not, eradicate it.
