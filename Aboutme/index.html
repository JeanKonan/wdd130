    <h2>Jean KONAN</h2>
    <p>
        I am from Cote d'Ivoire. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints since 2012. I served
        a full-time mission and came back in November 2018. I am currently working as a technical advisor in a call
        center. If I were to choose a word to descrive my personality, I would choose CREATIVITY. And that's certainly
        the reason why I decided to pursue a degree in Applied Technology. I believe technology can help improve lives
        of billions of people. Web design is a way for me to render [virtual] life more beautiful. During my leasure
        time, I like singing, drawing and playing basketball and soccer. I also like playing video games.

        you fpr visiting!
